# StudentManagement
This is a Python program that myself and a few others in my Python 2 class have created. It is a student management program, that allows you to create, modify, and delete students. It also writes all of your information to a .json file to save everything as well. 



Make sure to download colorama library and sqlalchemy 

python3 -m pip install colorama or pip install colorama works

In order to run the program, just run the LoginAdmin.py file within in the folder!
